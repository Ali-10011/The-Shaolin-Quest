# The-Shaolin-Quest
The Shaolin Quest - a game with a lot of learning oppurtunites.

I created this game as my participation submission for the Rookie game jam of summer 2022.

Make Takeways:
Collaborated with my team - Mind Blenders - to plan, design and create the game. 
Lead my team as the team leader and game designer, learning 	team communication, work distribution, idea organisation and several other team project related skills.
This project opened a lot of learning opportunites for me even motivation me to learn about project management including AGILE and JIRA.
Endless exposure in corporate environment of mindstorm studios which created a lot of abstract learning opportunities.
